# User Movement in Location-Based Social Networks in Megalopolises

## Abstract
Foursquare is a location-based social network based on check-ins similar to Gowalla and Brightkite. In this case, the dataset contains information about check-ins for two densely populated cities: New York and Tokyo. The idea behind this extension is to study the effect of human mobility in much more densely populated areas.  Indeed, a lot of people move to such attractive cities looking for out of habit experiences. By comparing the mobility patterns from these two megalopolises to those showcased in the paper “Friendship and Mobility”, we hope to pinpoint trends which would justify this attraction to cities.  Given that these cities are bubbling with life, we would like to investigate and understand if daily routines are still present, or if there is more entropy in human movement.
